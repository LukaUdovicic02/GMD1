# Blog post #1 : Roll a ball 

### Introduction

In this first blog post I have done an small tutorial for a roll a boll project using Unity.It is essencially just a guide step by step of a basic unity project. The game is covering basic concepts , game objects , components , scripting as well as usage of the unity program ui.The goal of the game is to pick up the collectables using Input from keyboard and after completing users wins the game.

### Reflections:

When I started working on the tutorial , the begining part was little overwealming with unity with all the bells and whistles waht unity has to offer , so it took some time to check what is what in the tutorial. Also what intrigued me is the physics for example when not having an plane you are gonna fall down which was cool. Also how we can play with camera and make like scripts to control the game objects.However, I must admit that the most challenging aspect of the tutorial for me was checking into the realm of C# scripting. Concepts such as vectors and transform methods initially seemed weird and new. It took some time and effort to understand their importance and see how they could be applied in practical terms within the context of the game.

So for this example here it was hard at first to get it becasue I did not understand how the camera works and also how can applying different game object affect it , then like why use LateUpdate and so on...

Overall, working through the roll-a-ball tutorial was like an stepping stone to go explore more and get some experience. I look forward to applying the knowledge and skills I've gained from this tutorial to future game project.
